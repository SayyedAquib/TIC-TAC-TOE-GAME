# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

The Tic Tac Toe Game is based on a two-player game. Each player chooses between X and O. Player plays one move at a time simultaneously. In a move, a player can choose any position from a 3×3 grid. The goal here is to get three consecutive X or O in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction. There is a single activity in this application. This activity will show a 3×3 grid. The status of the game will be displayed at the bottom and I also add a button to reset the game anytime when the user wants.
